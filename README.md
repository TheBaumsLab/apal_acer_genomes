# Genome assemblies, genetic maps, and annotations of Acropora palmata and Acropora cervicornis

Here, we make available the code and genomic resources described in [Locatelli et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.22.573044).

In `jupyter_notebooks/`, we provide code for _Acropora cervicornis_ (prefix `Acervicornis` in all files) genome assembly, gene prediction, and functional annotation in FunAnnotate. We additionally provide code for _Acropora palmata_ (prefix `Apalmata` in all files) and _Acropora cervicornis_ linkage map generation using LepWrap. Further, we provide code for some figure generation, whole genome alignments and dotplots, and phylogenetically significant gene family expansion analyses (CAFE5).
